🔐 Password Cracking & Credential Attack Suite
(Ethical Security Assessment Project)
Author: Ayyavari Vamshi Krishna
License: MIT
Platform: Kali Linux
Language: Python 3
📌 Project Overview
The Password Cracking & Credential Attack Suite is an academic cybersecurity project developed to demonstrate how weak passwords can be exploited using common attack techniques and how defenders can evaluate and strengthen password security.
This project was implemented strictly in a controlled and ethical laboratory environment for educational purposes. No real systems, live user accounts, or unauthorized credentials were targeted at any stage.
🎯 Project Objectives
To understand common password attack techniques
To simulate dictionary-based and brute-force password attacks
To analyze password strength using complexity and entropy
To generate a final security audit report with mitigation recommendations
To demonstrate both Red Team (attack) and Blue Team (defense) security perspectives
🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
Operating System: Kali Linux
Programming Language: Python 3
Development Environment: Kali Linux Terminal
Editor: nano
Python Standard Libraries:
itertools
string
math
datetime
🔍 Project Modules
1️⃣ Dictionary Generator
Generates realistic password wordlists using common attacker patterns such as:
Name-based passwords
Year appending
Capitalization
Leet-speak substitutions
This demonstrates how predictable password patterns weaken security.
2️⃣ Brute-Force Simulator
Simulates brute-force password attacks by systematically attempting all possible combinations from a defined character set.
This module demonstrates how:
Weak passwords are cracked quickly
Password length significantly impacts attack complexity
3️⃣ Password Strength Analyzer
Evaluates passwords from a defensive (Blue Team) perspective by analyzing:
Password length
Character diversity (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols)
Estimated entropy
Passwords are classified as Weak, Medium, Strong, or Very Strong.
4️⃣ Security Audit Report Generator
Generates a final security audit report summarizing:
Identified password vulnerabilities
Attack simulation observations
Recommended password security best practices
🧪 Project Execution Summary
The project was fully developed and executed on Kali Linux using terminal-based Python scripts.
Each module was executed independently, and all outputs, code explanations, and execution screenshots were documented for academic verification.
📘 All screenshots, implementation details, and code explanations are included within the project documentation PDF provided in this repository.
