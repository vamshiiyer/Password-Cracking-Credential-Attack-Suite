## 📌 Project Overview

The **Password Cracking & Credential Attack Suite** is an academic cybersecurity project developed to demonstrate how weak passwords can be exploited using common attack techniques and how defenders can evaluate and strengthen password security.

This project was implemented strictly in a **controlled and ethical laboratory environment** for educational purposes.  
No real systems, live user accounts, or unauthorized credentials were targeted.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Understand common password attack techniques  
- Simulate dictionary-based and brute-force password attacks  
- Analyze password strength using complexity and entropy  
- Generate a final security audit report with mitigation recommendations  
- Demonstrate **Red Team (attack)** and **Blue Team (defense)** perspectives  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Operating System:** Kali Linux  
- **Programming Language:** Python 3  
- **Development Environment:** Kali Linux Terminal  
- **Editor:** nano  
- **Python Standard Libraries:**  
  - itertools  
  - string  
  - math  
  - datetime

## 🔍 Project Modules

### 1️⃣ Dictionary Generator
Generates realistic password wordlists using:
- Name-based passwords  
- Year appending  
- Capitalization  
- Leet-speak substitutions  

This demonstrates how predictable password patterns weaken security.

---

### 2️⃣ Brute-Force Simulator
Simulates brute-force password attacks by systematically attempting all possible combinations from a defined character set.

This module demonstrates that:
- Weak passwords are cracked quickly  
- Password length significantly impacts attack complexity  

---

### 3️⃣ Password Strength Analyzer
Evaluates passwords from a defensive (Blue Team) perspective by analyzing:
- Password length  
- Character diversity (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols)  
- Estimated entropy  

Passwords are classified as **Weak, Medium, Strong, or Very Strong**.

---

### 4️⃣ Security Audit Report Generator
Generates a final security audit report summarizing:
- Identified password vulnerabilities  
- Attack simulation observations  
- Recommended password security best practices  

---

## 🧪 Project Execution Summary

The project was fully developed and executed on **Kali Linux** using terminal-based Python scripts.  
Each module was executed independently, and all outputs were documented for academic verification.

📘 **All screenshots, implementation details, and code explanations are included inside the project documentation PDF.**
