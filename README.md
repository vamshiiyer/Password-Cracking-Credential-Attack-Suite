## 📌 Project Overview

The **Password Cracking & Credential Attack Suite** is a cybersecurity internship project developed to demonstrate **ethical password security assessment techniques** in a controlled and authorized environment.

The project focuses on understanding how weak passwords can be exploited using common attack methodologies and how defenders can evaluate and improve password security through structured analysis and reporting.

⚠️ No real systems, live user accounts, or unauthorized credentials were targeted at any stage of this project.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Simulate common credential attack techniques in an ethical lab environment  
- Understand dictionary-based and brute-force password attacks  
- Analyze password strength using complexity and entropy metrics  
- Generate a security audit report with mitigation recommendations  
- Apply **Red Team (attack)** and **Blue Team (defense)** security concepts  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Operating System:** Kali Linux  
- **Programming Language:** Python 3  
- **Development Environment:** Kali Linux Terminal  
- **Editor:** nano  
- **Python Standard Libraries:**  
  - itertools  
  - string  
  - math

## 🔍 Project Modules

### 1️⃣ Dictionary Generator
Generates realistic password wordlists using commonly observed attacker patterns such as:
- Name-based combinations  
- Year appending  
- Capitalization  
- Leet-speak substitutions  

This module demonstrates how predictable password patterns significantly weaken security.

---

### 2️⃣ Brute-Force Simulator
Simulates brute-force password attacks by systematically attempting all possible combinations from a defined character set.

This module highlights:
- How weak passwords are compromised quickly  
- The exponential increase in attack complexity with longer passwords  

---

### 3️⃣ Password Strength Analyzer
Analyzes passwords from a defensive (Blue Team) perspective by evaluating:
- Password length  
- Character diversity (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols)  
- Estimated entropy  

Passwords are classified as **Weak, Medium, Strong, or Very Strong**.

---

### 4️⃣ Security Audit Report Generator
Generates a final security audit report summarizing:
- Identified password vulnerabilities  
- Attack simulation observations  
- Recommended password security best practices  

This module consolidates findings from all previous modules.
